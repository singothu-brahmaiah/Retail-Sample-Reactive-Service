React spring boot with mongo data base

REACT SPRING BOOT APPLICATION :
 Implemented by using below concepts ,
 
 1. NOSQL DB(Mongo) 
 2. Create the application.yml file rather than to use the application.properties(YAML is more readable)
 3. Write the Junit and Integration Test Cases for each and every class
 4. Use Lombok dependency in code (donâ€™t write setter/getter/constructor), use the Lombok annotation i.e @Builder/@Setter/@Getter/@NoArgConstructor..
 5. Use the @Slf4J for logging and create the logback file and specify the log pattern and file location
 6. Keep code coverage 90% in maven jacaco report
 7. Include Spring Security by using OAuth 2.0 framework (Generate the JWT token and validate it) and pass it in subsequent request
 8. Use the Java ENUM rather than to create the java constant file 
 9. Swagger for testing API testing 
 10. Actuator for monitoring application like metrics, mappings and info 
 11. Lomback - logs print to the both console and file audit 
 12. Use the final word infront of any object or primitive declaration
 13. Create Util for token validation
 14. Use the @NotNull and @NotBlank annotations attribute validation
 15. ReactiveMongoRepository for connecting the Mongo Database and traversing the data
 16. Junit code coverage 
 17. webclient to communication between the reactAPI's
